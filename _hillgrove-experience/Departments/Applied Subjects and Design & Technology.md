#### **Mission**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### **Applied Subjects**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
To nurture problem solving skills and stimulate curiosity & interest in technology <br>
To provide students with hands-on exploration to construct meaning for themselves through concrete experiences, and to learn in ways that allow them to apply knowledge to real world situations.

The Applied Subjects Unit, which consists of Mobile Robotics (NT) and Electronics (O level), aims to inculcate attitudes relevant to engineering such as perseverance, curiosity, integrity, striving for accuracy, inventiveness, problem-solving (“can do” attitude) and intellectual thoroughness. The two years upper secondary curriculum is designed for students to acquire knowledge of the fundamentals of electronics and mobile robotics, to foster an interest and passion in the engineering field in preparation for post- secondary engineering courses.

##### **Design & Technology**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hillgrovians are engaged in a learning environment that gradually deepens and expands their understanding, knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems through the D&T curriculum. Students acquire the techniques and strategies of design thinking skill, as well as basic design, technology, sketching and 3D manipulation skills to carry out a design process in conceptualising design ideas and transforming that idea into something real. Moreover, students practise “learning by doing” via seeking design solutions based on thoughtful consideration of the users and have the opportunity to co-create innovative products to meet users’ needs and/or encourage people to change their behaviour to save the environment.

##### **Design & Technology - Secondary 1 Projects**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondary One Express and Normal (Academic) students embark on a design and make an Enviro-Handphone Holder that serves to inculcate the preservation of natural resources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### **Design & Technology - Secondary 2 Projects**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondary Two Express and Normal (Academic) students apply the design process to develop a design solution that encourages the reduction of resource wastage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### **Design & Technology - Secondary 3 Projects**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondary Three students deepen their understanding of the design thinking process by seeking design solutions to improve the lives of people such as the needy and elderly using the technological knowledge and skills learnt in Structures, Mechanisms and Basic Electricity and Electronics content.
