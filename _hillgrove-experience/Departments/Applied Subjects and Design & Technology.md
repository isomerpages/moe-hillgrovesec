#### **Mission**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### **Applied Subjects**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
To nurture problem solving skills and stimulate curiosity & interest in technology <br>
To provide students with hands-on exploration to construct meaning for themselves through concrete experiences, and to learn in ways that allow them to apply knowledge to real world situations.

The Applied Subjects Unit, which consists of Mobile Robotics (NT) and Electronics (O level), aims to inculcate attitudes relevant to engineering such as perseverance, curiosity, integrity, striving for accuracy, inventiveness, problem-solving (“can do” attitude) and intellectual thoroughness. The two years upper secondary curriculum is designed for students to acquire knowledge of the fundamentals of electronics and mobile robotics, to foster an interest and passion in the engineering field in preparation for post- secondary engineering courses.
