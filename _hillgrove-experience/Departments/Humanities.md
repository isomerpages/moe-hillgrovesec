#### **Mission**

------------------------------------------------------------
The Humanities Department strives to provide an engaging and enriching programme to enthuse Hillgrovians in the study of the Humanities and to equip them with creative and thinking skills.

In line with the school vision “Reflective Learners, Caring Changemakers”, the department’s Core Programme focuses on inquiry-based learning where students learn to understand the world issues by taking different perspectives and communicate their arguments coherently in both speech and writing. Learning is further enhanced through Assessment for Learning, Assessment as Learning and online technological tools on Student Learning Space (SLS).
