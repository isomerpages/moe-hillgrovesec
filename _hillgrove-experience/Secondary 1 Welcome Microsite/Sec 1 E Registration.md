Welcome to Hillgrove Secondary School.

To safeguard the health of our staff, students and the general public, we are conducting e-registration for 2022 Sec 1 Registration Exercise to minimise the amount of time parents/guardians need to spend in school.

*   E-register your child/ward via Parents’ Gateway app. You should receive a notification via this app by 6pm on 22 Dec 2021. Please contact the school at 6560 3726 should you be unable to do the e-registration via Parents’ Gateway app.
