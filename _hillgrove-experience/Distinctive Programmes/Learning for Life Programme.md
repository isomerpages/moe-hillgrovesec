#### **Overview**
At Hillgrove, we believe strongly in the holistic education of every student, and that arts education is a powerful tool that helps our students become values-centered and creative citizens of tomorrow.

Our Learning for Life Programme focuses on the Arts, with the mission of nurturing confident, passionate and future-ready Hillgrovians through the arts.

2.  Provide every single Hillgrovian with opportunities at different levels to **discover** and **develop** their **interests and passion** in the Arts
    
3.  Nurture and build our students’ **character and values**, help them **articulate and express** themselves effectively through the arts, thereby equipping them with the **skills and dispositions to carry them far in life**
    
4.  Deliver **quality and holistic arts education** to develop all Hillgrovians into **well-rounded individuals**
