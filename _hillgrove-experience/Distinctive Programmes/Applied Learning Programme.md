--------------------------------------------------------------
#### **Overview**

--------------------------------------------------------------
##### **Key Aims**
1.  Broaden our students’ exposure to Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM) through flight & aerospace.
    
2.  Excite students about STEM through hands-on and authentic learning experiences.

Beginning this year, the school adopted “Future of Transportation” as the Contextual Theme for our STEM ALP.

One of the aspects of Future of Transportation that our students are learning about is autonomous vehicles. Through the mBot, our students get a chance to learn about and experience some of the principles behind autonomous vehicles, like line tracing and obstacle avoidance.

Our school was pleased to host Ghostcat Medienproduktion <br> GmbH, a German media production company¸ as they wanted<br> to film our school’s ALP programme to bring it to a German TV audience.

Ever wished you had a chance to fly a drone?

Our students at Hillgrove can. In fact, through our STEM ALP,<br> every Secondary 2 student gets a chance to fly a drone.<br> And not just fly a drone, but also code a drone to perform<br> different tasks.

Beginning from January 2019, the school’s focus on Flight & Aerospace was broadened to include aspects of computational thinking within the weekly STEM ALP lessons.

2019 also saw the introduction of Potato Pirates <br> into the STEM ALP curriculum as a game-based<br> pedagogy. Students are introduced to basic programming <br>concepts such as loops & conditional through playing the<br> game, all without getting bogged down by any syntax.

##### **2016**

Ever wondered how a Paper Airplane would fly in space?

Four Hillgrove Secondary School students did.

They got the answer when their experiment was chosen to be conducted on board the International Space Station in September 2016. They had submitted a proposal to the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and were invited to the JAXA Tsukuba Space Center to witness their experiment being conducted live on board the International Space Station.

This was the first time that a Singapore proposal was selected!
