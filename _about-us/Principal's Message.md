### **Principal's Message**

Our young have so much potential. We are glad that we have the privilege to be part of their lives as they spend their secondary school years with us. We would want to nurture them holistically – taking care of their physical, emotional, social and intellectual development and also ensuring that they are taught good and enduring values.  With the fast pace of change (and change being many), it will also be needful for our young to be guided and equipped with the right attitude, skills and dispositions that will help them to be future-ready.

We envision all our students to be **reflective learners** and **caring changemakers**. We believe that our students have a lot to offer if they are well guided and they take responsibility for their learning, their actions and their growth.

We believe that with the school working together with important partners like parents and guardians of our students and community partners, we can help our students develop and flourish.  With a caring and warm school environment, we can nurture every Hillgrovian to be the best he/she can be.

Every child comes to us with diverse strengths and interests. At Hillgrove, we want to support every Hillgrovian in discovering their passions, talents and potentials. Our distinctive programmes in **_Flight & Aerospace_** and **_the Arts_** are some of the avenues for Hillgrovians to uncover their passions, find connections between academic knowledge and skills in the real world as well as develop their character and values through experiential learning.

I would like to wish all Hillgrovians well as they grow and learn in the school.  I am confident that our Hillgrovians have much to learn and contribute and I wish each Hillgrovian a meaningful journey with us.

Last but not least, to all Hillgrovians, may you be guided by sound values as you equip yourselves with the necessary knowledge and skills.  May you always have the drive to keep learning as you continue to care and make a difference to those around you.
