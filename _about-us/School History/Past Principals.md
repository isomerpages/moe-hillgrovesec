### **Past Principals**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Past Principals of the School
Founded in 2001 with 277 students, Hillgrove first operated on shared premises with Yusof Ishak Secondary School. It was established as a result of the expressed vision of Mr Ang Mong Seng, former Member of Parliament for Bukit Gombak, that the constituency should have a full secondary school that would meet the needs of the residents in the area.

Mdm Thoo Mei Lan was the founding Principal and introduced its first Outreach Programme to provide Hillgrovians with the opportunity to engage in challenging outdoor activities to build their confidence, team spirit and leadership qualities. As a new school in an established housing estate, the school harnessed the location and history of Bukit Batok to strengthen her studentsâ€™ pride and sense of identity and empower them to make positive contributions to the community at large.
