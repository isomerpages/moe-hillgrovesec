### **School Overview**
-------------------------------------------------------------

#### School Vision

**Reflective Learners, Caring Changemakers**

Hillgrove’s vision of “Reflective Learners, Caring Changemakers” describes a community of others-centred individuals who will learn, unlearn and relearn. Hillgrovians will be nurtured to our fullest potential so as to enable us to make a difference in our community and the world at large.

As Reflective Learners, Hillgrovians enjoy learning and find learning meaningful and relevant to real life. We take ownership of our learning and regulate our efforts to gain mastery. We explore and develop our interests and strengths, fuelling a desire for lifelong learning.

As Caring Changemakers, Hillgrovians care about what matters in our community.  We gather knowledge and resources to make change happen. Making a change within ourselves first, we inspire and influence others to make a difference.
