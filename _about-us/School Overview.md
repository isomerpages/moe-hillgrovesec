### **School Overview**
-------------------------------------------------------------

#### School Vision

##### **Reflective Learners, Caring Changemakers**

Hillgrove’s vision of “Reflective Learners, Caring Changemakers” describes a community of others-centred individuals who will learn, unlearn and relearn. Hillgrovians will be nurtured to our fullest potential so as to enable us to make a difference in our community and the world at large.

As Reflective Learners, Hillgrovians enjoy learning and find learning meaningful and relevant to real life. We take ownership of our learning and regulate our efforts to gain mastery. We explore and develop our interests and strengths, fuelling a desire for lifelong learning.

As Caring Changemakers, Hillgrovians care about what matters in our community.  We gather knowledge and resources to make change happen. Making a change within ourselves first, we inspire and influence others to make a difference.

#### School Crest

The school crest is set against a clear background. It is distinctively marked by a cluster of trees with trunks that are intertwined. This symbolises a grove of trees, as inspired by the name of the school. The interlinking of the trunks represents the active interactions between Hillgrove teachers and students. It also signifies the moral and spiritual support students draw from one another.

The slant at the base suggests that the trees have firm roots and stand tall on a slope of a hill. This is another reference to the school’s name.

The large crown of eighteen leaves in varying sizes represents healthy growth so that this produces shelter and shade for those who seek it. The shared foliage signifies the common goal and unity that staff and students share.

 Set together, the design elements express the school’s desire to be a safe environment that encourages young people to grow in values and skills needed to face life’s challenges.
 
 #### The Hillgrove Philosophy
 Hillgrove believes in the potential of students, builds their character and helps them succeed.
