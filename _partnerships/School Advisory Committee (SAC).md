### **School Advisory Committee (SAC)**
---------------------------------------------------------------

The School Advisory Committee (SAC) provides an opportunity for community partners to participate actively at Hillgrove to build a dynamic, strong and self-reliant generation.  In the process, it aims to develop scholastic talents and healthy pursuits, as well as a strong sense of belonging to the nation.  The role of the SAC is to promote a closer relationship between the community and the school through the collaborative work of taking care of student welfare, encourage students’ co-curricular activities aimed at character development and to raise funds for carrying out such activities.
