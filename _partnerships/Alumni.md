### **Hillgrove Alumni**
-----------------------------------------------------------
#### **Partners as vital links (Alumni in Education)**

Hillgrove recognizes the vital role of our partners to provide a holistic educational experience for our students. We have a Parents Alumni Link (PAL) which forms a close relationship with our parents through the **H**ill**g**rove **Al**umni (HGA)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Formed in 2009, the HGA is a vital link for the school to reach out to graduate pupils to support school programmes. The Alumni is formed by Hillgrove graduates. Members of the alumni are role models for the pupils. They continue their passion for the school through their active participation in relief teaching and CCA. The Friends of Hillgrove (Alumni) Award serves to recognise our alumni members' value added contributions that have a positive impact on the school.
