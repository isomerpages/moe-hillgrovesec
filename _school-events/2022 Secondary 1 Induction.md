### **2022 Secondary 1 Induction**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our school held the Orientation Programme for our new Secondary One students in the first week of January.

As part of the Orientation Programme, the Secondary One students took part in a series of talks as well as activities such as Treasure Hunt, CCA Orientation, and a Computer Mastery Programme. In the process, they bonded with their classmates and teachers, and learnt how to adjust to secondary school life.

The highlight of the programme was the Induction Ceremony and Finale Night on 7 January. During the Induction Ceremony, Form Teachers and Co-Form Teachers pinned the 2022 Hillgrove Pin onto each of their student as a mark of school belonging and identity. The pin is significant as it encompasses the school mission and motto, amongst others.

We warmly welcome the Secondary One students into the Hillgrove family, and wish them a fruitful year of learning and growth ahead!
