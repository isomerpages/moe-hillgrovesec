### **Overcoming The Odds**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irham Rizqie Bin Mohammed Sani from Class 4-3, was featured in CNA News and Berita Harian during the release of 2021 GCE ‘N’ Level Results. Irham was grateful for the school community at Hillgrove Secondary School and advised his juniors to “surround yourself with good friends”. The Chairperson of the Media Club was able to count on his friends to help him overcome his colour-blindness in media-related activities. Irham’s resilience and never-give-up spirit enabled him to score a Grade 1 for Humanities and passing his Mathematics in this year’s N-Level examinations. He also thanked his sister for being a source of inspiration and role model to him. Irham hopes to pursue IT-related courses in the future. Well done, Irham! We are proud of you!
