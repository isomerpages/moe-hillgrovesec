### **Mother Tongue Fortnight 2022**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mother Tongue Fortnight kicks off every year in February with a slew of interesting activities. Through the combined effort from the two language units, a variety of activities were organised to create an immersive environment for the learning and appreciation of Mother Tongue Languages. Our Sec 1 students had fun with Lantern Painting, Patchwork Quilt, and games like Capteh and Diabolo. The Sec 2s, on the other hand, had sessions dedicated to the appreciation of xinyao, referring to the genre of Mandarin songs composed by young Singaporeans tracing back to the 1970s. Finally, our Sec 3s immersed in inter-racial drumming with their classmates.
