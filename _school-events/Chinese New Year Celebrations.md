### **Chinese New Year Celebrations 2022**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In celebration of Lunar New Year this year, our Hillgrovians were treated to an exciting E-Concert and Escape Room activity. Earlier, they also participated in classroom decoration and donated food items for hamper wrapping. The food hampers will be given out to beneficiaries from REACH community services, Ren Ci and our contract cleaners. Wishing everyone good health and success in the year ahead!
