### **Sec 2 STEAM Camp**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the Sec 1s had fun with their adventure camp, our Sec 2s immersed in a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) Camp. They used the micro:bit to code a queue management system, taking inspiration from buzzer systems that notify you when your food order is ready for collection. They even had the chance to get creative by using a 3D pen to create raised graphics of objects such as Singapore's famed chilli crab dish.
