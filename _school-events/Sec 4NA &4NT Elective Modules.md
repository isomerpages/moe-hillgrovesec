### **Sec 4NA/4NT Elective Modules**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Sec 4NA/NT students were treated to a host of elective modules, which are short, hands-on courses related to ITE and Polytechnic courses. In the process, students discovered their personal strengths and interests, which will help them make more informed Education and Career choices (ECG) in future. The courses offered over the 3 programme days were: Aerospace Engineering, Sports and Wellness, Arts and Entertainment, and F&B Services. For example, as part of Aerospace Engineering, students learnt about air traffic control, designing and constructing gliders, flight simulation etc. The students had fun as they picked up new skills that are outside of their current regular curriculum.
