### **AEDGE 2022**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Art Educators’ Developmental and Generative Explorations marks the 11th edition of the annual art exhibition organized by the Singapore Teachers’ Academy for the Arts (STAR) to nurture the professional identity of art teachers as Teacher-Artists. The exhibition was held at School of the Arts (SOTA) from 11 to 20 March.

We are proud that Hillgrove’s very own Art teachers, Ms Amanda Soo and Mr Rozaimi (with Mdm Nurul Afia as an artist-contributor) participated in this exhibition to showcase their art pieces to the wider public.
