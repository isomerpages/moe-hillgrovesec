### **Singapore Youth Festival 2021**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since 1966, the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) has been an annual event organised by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the vitality of our youth and their diverse arts talents. In addition, SYF also serves as a platform for the development of cultural awareness and appreciation through aesthetics education.

Due to the heightened safety measures as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic this year, SYF has brought their stage online! The various aesthetic groups in Hillgrove had also risen up to the challenge and achieved meritorious awards, displaying their tenacity, hard work and adaptability. Congratulations to the various aesthetic groups!
