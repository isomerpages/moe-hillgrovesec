### **Sec 1 Personal Device Learning Programme**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
At MOEâ€™s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. Last year, Hillgrovians successfully received their school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD), the Apple iPad. Since then, it has greatly enriched our Teaching and Learning, as teachers and students tapped on a variety of technological platforms to engage in collaborative and self-directed learning.

Last week was a special moment for our new Sec 1 students as they too received their own Apple iPads. Our school leaders handed over the iPads to the chairperson of each class. Students excitedly unboxed their iPads, following which Form Teachers brought them through an administrative process of setting up the iPad. We look forward to engaging our Sec 1s through their new PLDs.
