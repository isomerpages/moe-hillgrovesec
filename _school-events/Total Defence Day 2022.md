### **Total Defence Day 2022**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This year, our school commemorated Total Defence Day by having a number of activities and programmes.

First, we had the Total Defence skit, titled, SCAM, by our own NE advocates which aired on 11th Feb 2022 during C space. The skit showed how students may get scammed by social media activities such as Instagram where scammers could request to be friends using fake identities. The scammers may, for example, request for money or black mail them with the victim’s photos. This correlates with one of the pillars of Total Defence which is Digital Defence.

Next we had the Total Defence Day digital face mask challenge for the Secondary 1 and 2 students. They can use their PLD or computers to design the mask where the top 3 entries will receive prizes. Our NE advocates also worked together to come up with Total Defence Day booth which was displayed during recess on 15th February. A word of thanks to one of our NE advocates, Ryan Jacob, who brought his attire from the British Colonial era (Picture attached) and Temasek green uniforms for our display booth!

We had a treasure hunt where students needed to find the symbols of the 6 Total Defence pillars around the school starting from 9th Feb 2022 and ending on 18th Feb 2022. We were able to display SG Secure banners, loaned to us by the Bukit Batok Neighbourhood Police Centre. We also had Total Defence lesson packages for students based on the Straits Times (IN) which were conducted during CCE period.

Furthermore, some of our NE advocates were able to participate in the Jurong Fire Station virtual tour on 12 Feb 2022 by Singapore Civil Defence Force. The students learned about Community Emergency Preparedness Programme, Public Education Advisories, and station routines and emergency vehicles.

Last but not least, there was a virtual assembly performance by the Finger Players, titled: “My friend, the Japanese Soldier”, which was aired live on 16th Feb 2022 during PG lesson. The performance showcased the importance of Total Defence and the valuable lessons that we can learn based on the Japanese conquest of Singapore during World War 2.
