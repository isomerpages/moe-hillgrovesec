### **21st Annual Speech Day**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the 8th of April, Hillgrove Secondary School held our 21st Annual Speech Day. This year’s Speech Day is themed “Bridging New Frontiers” – an acknowledgement of Hillgrove’s constant innovation in teaching and learning so that we can stay relevant, even in the current endemic period. Although most teachers and students could not be present at the event itself, many of them joined in the celebrations via Zoom.

The event was graced by the Guest-of-Honour, Ms Serene Yong, Chairperson of the School’s Advisory Committee. Ms Serene Yong gave out awards to affirm recently-graduated Hillgrovians who have demonstrated exemplary qualities and achievements. Our Principal, Mrs Helen Tan, followed by presenting awards to our Parents Support Group and teachers. In particular, the Hillgrove Long Service Award was presented to Ms Lim Sik Choo and Mr Yang Guangshan, both of whom have dedicated their teaching service to Hillgrove for the past 20 years.

Our Valedictorian for the Class of 2021, Dinesh Josh Pubalan, delivered his Valedictorian’s Speech at the event. Our guests were also treated to a medley of live and recorded performances by our very own Boys’ Brigade, Malay Dance, Modern Dance, Concert Band, and Choir CCAs.

Congratulations to our award winners! We hope our Hillgrovians have been inspired by their seniors to soar and achieve their fullest potential.
