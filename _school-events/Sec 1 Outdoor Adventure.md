### **Sec 1 Outdoor Adventure Learning Programme**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the Common Tests concluded, our Sec 1s, 2s, 4s and 5s were treated to an enriching line-up of Cohort Programme activities from 2 March to 4 March.

The Sec 1s were involved in a school-based Outdoor Adventure Learning Programme. They participated in Archery Tag, Low Elements, Team Building/ Problem Solving Games, and Leadership Modules, amongst others. By being actively involved in the activities and reflecting on their experiences, our students learnt how to persevere to complete a task, contribute effectively to group goals, and how to be a reflective and caring leader.
