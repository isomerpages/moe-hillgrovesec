### **Cohort Post Exam Activities**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the school’s post-exam programme at the end of May, all four levels of students participated in a variety of enrichment activities.

Our Secondary One students headed out of school to Sentosa for their Humanities Learning Journey. At Fort Siloso, Singapore’s only well-preserved coastal fort today, students explored WWII memorabilia such as coastal guns and the remains of fortified tunnels. This served as an immersive precursor to what they will learn in History lessons this and next year.

The Secondary Two students had fun with a Poetry Slam Workshop. The workshop covered techniques of writing poetry for performance as well as kinesthetic learning. Students were invited to explore the use of their body parts and facial expressions to convey certain ideas. At the end of the workshop, our students were very much inspired by the  poetry slam performances put up by their peers.

Our Secondary Two NT students, on the other hand, were engaged in a Puppetry Workshop where they learnt how to make their own puppets. Students worked together to come up with an interesting storyboard for a puppet show, and learnt how to make use of light and shadow to create visual effects.

Finally, the Secondary Four and Five students spent their time at Hillgrove’s very own Careers Day. Speakers working in different occupations including nursing, finance, cyber security and digital media were invited down to share their working experiences with students. Students attended two sharings based on their personal interest and aspirations. It was an enriching experience as students got an authentic insight into the nature, opportunities, and challenges within a particular job.
