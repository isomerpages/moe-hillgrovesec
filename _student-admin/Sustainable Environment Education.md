### **Sustainable Environment Education**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hillgrove Secondary School believes in the holistic education of her students. Placing strong emphasis in protecting the environment, a sustainable environment education (SEE) programme was introduced in 2015 to instill critical thinking amongst her students and guide them in making green decisions for a green lifestyle. “Every small lifestyle change can make a difference in saving the environment” is the key message to all Hillgrovians.
