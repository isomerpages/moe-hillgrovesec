### **School Life Coaching**
-------------------------------------------------------------------
#### **Overview**

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Adolescence is a transitional stage of physical and mental human development generally characterized as beginning and ending with the teenage stage (secondary school years). This life stage is characterized by the dynamics of the students’ cognitive, emotional, physical and social developments. In order to be successful in life, it is especially important for students to learn how to adjust to and cope with all these developmental changes.

When students come for life coaching, they will have a chance to talk about any issue that is of concern to them while the coach listens to them non-judgmentally. The coach explores life issues together with the students to develop insights and skills so that they would be empowered to manage their issues better. Individual and group coaching are conducted in congruence with the school values – Integrity, Care, Respect, Responsibility and Resilience.

#### **Confidentiality**

In the work with students, the coach subscribes to a confidentiality policy so as to create a safe environment for students to talk about their issues openly. However, effective coaching may, at times, require that the counsellor share confidential information with other stakeholders. Exceptions to the confidentiality policy apply in the situations below:

(i) Students give their consent to reveal certain information to other stakeholders;

(ii) Students intend to or have harmed themselves and/or others;

(iii) Students are referred to external agencies for more specialised professional attention

(iv) Information is required by the Courts of Law

-------------------------------------------------------------------
#### **Referral**

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Students may make an appointment to meet with the coach to discuss their issues by contacting the coach themselves. Some students may also be referred by their teachers if they are deemed to benefit from the coaching sessions.
