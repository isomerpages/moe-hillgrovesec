### **Assessment Plan**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parent Gateway Notification Number: HGV2022/094

15 Feb 2022

Dear Parent/Guardian,

Thank you for your support and partnership in your child’s/ward’s learning and growth in Hillgrove Secondary School. Assessment for and of Learning is important as the teachers work with your child/ward in the course of the year.

The 2022 Assessment Plan provides an overview of the school-based assessment structure in our school and we seek your support in monitoring your child’s/ward’s learning.

To strengthen holistic development and explore emerging and engaging pedagogies, the school adheres by Ministry of Education’s guidelines on assessment. There will be no Mid-Year Examination for Secondary 1 and 3 students in their transition years when they are exposed to new subjects with higher content rigour and/or expectations. One weighted assessment (WA) per subject per school term, with the exception of modular subjects, will be conducted. Assessment for modular subjects (Lower Sec D&T and FCE) are conducted on a semestral basis. These measures will help free up curriculum time for the school to explore strategies to deepen students’ engagement and develop 21st Century Competencies.

It is important that your child/ward commits to the daily assignments and homework given. Though not weighted, these assignments are formative and important in consolidating his/her learning and identifying learning gaps for corrective actions to be taken.

Thank you for working with us to support your child/ward in his/her learning.

In partnership with you,<br>
Mrs Helen Tan-Lee<br>
Principal
