#### **Description**
Hillgrove adopts a servant leadership framework in developing its school leaders. Student Councillors are tasked to lead in key school events such as the Secondary 1 Orientation Programme, Student Forum and Staff Appreciation Day to hone their leadership competencies. During the March holiday, leadership workshops are conducted for office holders in the CCAs and class committees.

#### **Highlights & Achievements**

The Student Council Investiture was held in term II. The graduating councillors were presented with a Certificate of Appreciation in recognition of their effort and contribution by Mrs Angeline Chan, our Principal. There was a symbolic act of handing over of leadership role to the new President of the Student Council. The newly formed Executive Committee and the council members were formally introduced to the rest of the school.

The Student Leadership Committee organised targeted and specific leadership modules for each of the different levels. Our student leaders will acquire the necessary skills and competencies required to operate effectively. For example, Sec 1 student leaders will learn about communication and listening skills. Sec 2 student leaders will learn about self management skills.

##### **Student Council Camp**

##### **Secondary 1 Orientation Camp**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sec 1 Orientation Programme is helmed by the Student Council as they plan programmes to welcome their juniors. It gives the new batches a familiar face to relate to, especially from their own primary school. School tours and ice breakers are organised to engage the Sec 1s and help them be more familiar with the new school environment.

There were dance items, songs of dedication and appreciation video montage put up by Hillgrovians. Followed by staff recognition awards ceremony in recognition of their contribution.
